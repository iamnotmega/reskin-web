To upload themes the Reskin Marketplace, you will need a Reskin account. For viewing other users' themes and downloading them, you won't need an account. Here's how to create an account:

<Tooltip
  src={homeImg.src}
  alt="Reskin app homepage screenshot"
  tooltips={[
    { x: 2, y: -2, text: "Open the side navigation." }
  ]}
/>

<Tooltip
  src={sidenavImg.src}
  alt="Reskin app side navigation screenshot"
  tooltips={[
    { x: 15, y: 10, text: "Press the Login button." }
  ]}
/>

<Tooltip
  src={loginImg.src}
  alt="Reskin app login page screenshot"
  tooltips={[
    { x: 15, y: 24, text: "If you have an account, enter your email here." },
    { x: 15, y: 39, text: "If you have an account, enter your password here." },
    { x: 15, y: 53, text: "Press the Login button." },
    { x: 55, y: 70, text: "If you don't have an account, click Sign up." },
  ]}
/>

<Tooltip
  src={signupImg.src}
  alt="Reskin app signup page screenshot"
  tooltips={[
    { x: 15, y: 24, text: "Enter your email address here." },
    { x: 15, y: 39, text: "Enter your desired username here." },
    { x: 15, y: 53, text: "Enter your desired password here." },

    { x: 55, y: 81, text: "If you have an account, click Log in." },

  tooltips={[
    { x: 50, y: 45, text: "Press the Marketplace button." }
  ]}
/>

<Tooltip

  alt="Reskin app marketplace screenshot"
  tooltips={[
    { x: 50, y: 0, text: "Press the Upload Theme button." }
