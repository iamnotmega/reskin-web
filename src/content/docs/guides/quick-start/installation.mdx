:::note
Due to the unique nature of its filesystem and package management, Reskin currently does not support NixOS.
:::

Reskin can be installed in 3 different ways outlined below. Before proceeding, please make sure you have installed all [prerequisites](/guides/prerequisites/).

### Pre-built Binary

This is the fastest and easiest way to get started. Simply download the pre-built binary and make it executable.

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/iamnotmega/reskin/releases) page

2. Download the binary

3. Make the binary executable:

```bash
chmod +x reskin
```

4. Run the binary:

```bash
./reskin
```

### Manual Installation

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

:::note
Please note that this method of installation only works on Arch Linux or distributions based on it.
:::

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si

```bash
yay -S reskin
```
