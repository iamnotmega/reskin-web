title: What is Reskin?

Reskin is a fully free and open-source theming app made exclusively for Linux-based operating systems. The app uses .reskin theme bundles which can be shared easily and installed offline. The app also has a marketplace to allow users to upload their own themes.

## Why Reskin?
Reskin has several advantages that make Linux theming easy and intuitive:

### Built to Perform
Reskin is built on the Tauri framework, which uses Rust for its backend and your system's native webview for its frontend. This powerful combination makes Reskin incredibly small and fast, so you get all the features you need without the bloat of other applications.

### A Unified Marketplace
The biggest advantage Reskin offers is a centralized marketplace. Right now, a user has to scour countless websites, forums, and GitHub repositories to find themes. Reskin solves this by providing a single, curated hub where they can browse, discover, and install themes directly from the app.

### Simplicity, Redefined
The traditional way of theming Linux is frustrating and difficult. It's a manual process of copying files, editing configuration files, and using command-line tools. Reskin is built from the ground up to be different. Its user-friendly interface and modern design make the entire process easy, and the .reskin format allows for one-click installation and sharing. It's the simplest and most intuitive theming solution available.
